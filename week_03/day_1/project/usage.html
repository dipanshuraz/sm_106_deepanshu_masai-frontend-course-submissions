          <h3>Usage share of Operating System
          </h3>
          <p>The usage share of operating systems is the percentage of computing devices that run each operating system at any particular time. All such figures are necessarily estimates because data about operating system share is difficult to obtain; there are few reliable primary sources – and no agreed methodologies for its collection.</p>

          <p>In the personal computing platform area of smartphones and watches Google's Android dominates with over 2.5 billion users.[2][3] Other mobile phone operating systems include Apple's iOS, KaiOS and Series 30+..</p>
          <p>  In the area of desktop and laptop computers, Microsoft Windows is generally above 70% in most markets and at 77% globally, Apple's macOS at around 13%, Google's ChromeOS at about 6% (in the US) and Linux at around 2%. All these figures vary somewhat in different markets, and depending on how they are gathered</p>

          <h4>Desktop and laptop computers</h4>
          <h4></h4>
          <p>Windows is still the dominant desktop OS, but the dominance varies by region and it has gradually lost market share to other desktop operating systems (not just to mobile) with the slide very noticeable in the US, where macOS usage has more than tripled from 2009 to 2017, with Windows down to 72.76% and Chrome OS at 3.33%, plus traditional Linux at 1.46%</p>
            <br>
          <p>The usage share of Microsoft's latest client operating system – Windows 10 – has been slowly increasing since July/August 2016 (while Windows 7 has had a slight decrease at the same time), reaching around 27.15% in December 2016.</p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p>Web analysis shows significant variation in different parts of the world. For example, in North America usage of Windows XP has dropped to 2.06%, but in Africa it is still at 11.02%[64] and Asia at 6.63%[65] (even higher in China, but down to 18.21%, tied with Windows 10 in second[66]) while going down, and has been overtaken by Windows 10. Conversely, macOS in North America claims 16.82%[67] (17.52%[68] in the US) whereas in Asia it is only 4.4%.</p>

          <h3>Microsoft data on Windows usage</h3>
          <p>In June 2016, Microsoft claimed Windows 10 had half the market share of all Windows installations in the USA and UK, as quoted by BetaNews:</p>
          <h4></h4>
          <blockquote>
              Microsoft's Windows trends page [shows] Windows 10 hit 50 percent in the US (51 percent in the UK, 39 percent globally), 
               while [..] Windows 7 was on 38 percent (36 percent in the UK, 46 percent globally). A big reason for the difference in
                numbers comes down to how they are recorded. [..] actual OS usage (based on web browsing), while Microsoft records the number of devices Windows 10 is installed on. [..] Microsoft also only records Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10, while NetMarketShare includes both XP and Vista.
